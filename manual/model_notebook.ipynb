    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`Chemical kinetics` is the study of chemical reactions with respect to reaction rates, effect of factors like  temperature, activation energy, stoichiometric coeffecients of reactants and products, etc. on these reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library `chemkin` is a simple library for handling such chemical reaction systems. A system of chemical reactions are input in a standard XML format and the library computes the reaction rates and progress rate of these reactions, based on the parameters passed in the XML. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a system of $N$ species undergoing $M$ **irreversible**, **elementary** reactions, the reaction rate of species $i$ is computed by - \n",

    "  f_{i} &= \\sum_{j=1}^{M}{\\nu_{ij}\\omega_{j}}, \\qquad i = 1, \\ldots, N\n",

    "The progress rate for each reaction is computed by \n",

    "The clients could call the chemkin package and obtained the right-hand-side of an ODE. They can then use it as the righ-hand-side of the ODE, or in a neural net code to learn new reaction pathways.\n",

    "## 2. Installation\n",
    "You can obtain the `chemical_kientics` Library [here](https://github.com/cs207-2017-group13/cs207-FinalProject).\n",
    "Users can run the test suite by calling pytest from the main directory, i.e. \n",

    "## 3. Basic Usage and Examples\n",
    "#### `XMLReader` class: Read and parse XML input file\n",
    "\n",
    "The user should have an XML input file containing all the chemical reactions. `XMLReader` will read in the file and parse the file with the `xml.etree` library. It will output a list of dictionaries containing all the elements needed to calculate reaction rate coefficients, progress rates and reaction rates. It will create `ElementaryReaction` objects inside the `get_reaction_systems` function, and then put all `ElementaryReaction` objects in a reaction system into a list. It will then create `ReactionSystem` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class contains one method: `get_reaction_systems()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "reader = XMLReader(\"tests/rxns.xml\")\n",
    "reaction_systems = reader.get_reaction_systems()\n",
    "```\n",
    "`reaction_systems` is a list containing multiple `ReactionSystem` instances. The length of `reaction_systems` is the number of reaction systems, and the length of each list element is the number of reactions in a reaction system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `ElementaryReaction` class: Class for each elementary reaction\n",
    "Takes a dictionary of properties from the XMLReader class for each elementary reaction. Calculates the rate coefficient for each elementary reaction and passes it to the ReactionSystem class. It also returns a dictionary of recatants and products to the ReactionSystem class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class has thee public methods, two private methods a special method:\n",
    " - `__repr__()`: Returns a string containing basic information about the elementary reaction\n",
    " - `get_reactants()`: Returns a dictionary with reactants as key and the stoichiometric coeff of reactants as value for each elementary reaction.\n",
    " - `get_products()`:  Returns a dictionary with products as key and the stoichiometric coeff of products as value for each elementary reaction.\n",
    " - `calculate_rate_coefficient(T)`: Calculates and returns the rate coeffiecient of the reaction based on the type of rate coefficient required.\n",
    " - `_constant_rate(k=1.0)`: Returns a constant reaction rate coefficient with default value as 1.0\n",
    " - `_k_arrhenius(A, E, T, b=0.0, R=8.314)`: Returns a reaction rate coefficient according to the Arrhenius equation. The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant, k, of a chemical reaction to parameters A (pre-exponential factor), E (activation energy), T (absolute temperature), and b (exponential indicating temperature-dependence of pre-exponential factor)::\n",
