    "#### `XMLReader` class: Read and parse XML input file\n",
    "\n",
    "The user should have an XML input file containing all the chemical reactions. `XMLReader` will read in the file and parse the file with the `xml.etree` library. It will output a list of dictionaries containing all the elements needed to calculate reaction rate coefficients, progress rates and reaction rates. It will create `ElementaryReaction` objects inside the `get_reaction_systems` function, and then put all `ElementaryReaction` objects in a reaction system into a list. It will then create `ReactionSystem` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This class contains one method: `get_reaction_systems()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "reader = XMLReader(\"tests/rxns.xml\")\n",
    "reaction_systems = reader.get_reaction_systems()\n",
    "```\n",
    "`reaction_systems` is a list containing multiple `ReactionSystem` instances. The length of `reaction_systems` is the number of reaction systems, and the length of each list element is the number of reactions in a reaction system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `ElementaryReaction` class: Class for each elementary reaction\n",
    "Takes a dictionary of properties from the XMLReader class for each elementary reaction. Calculates the rate coefficient for each elementary reaction and passes it to the ReactionSystem class. It also returns a dictionary of recatants and products to the ReactionSystem class.\n",

    " - `_constant_rate(k=1.0)`: Returns a constant reaction rate coefficient with default value as 1.0\n",
    " - `_k_arrhenius(A, E, T, b=0.0, R=8.314)`: Returns a reaction rate coefficient according to the Arrhenius equation. The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant, k, of a chemical reaction to parameters A (pre-exponential factor), E (activation energy), T (absolute temperature), and b (exponential indicating temperature-dependence of pre-exponential factor)::\n",
