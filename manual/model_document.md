# `chemical_kinetics` User Guide

## 1. Introduction

`chemical_kinetics` is a simple library for handling chemical reaction systems. Chemical reactions are input using a standard XML format, and reaction rates can be computed.

The clients could call the chemkin package and obtained the right-hand-side of an ODE. They can then use it as the righ-hand-side of the ODE, or in a neural net code to learn new reaction pathways.
